This is a script to enable an autoplay feature for the sites iwatch..... It is optimised for the style of iwatchtsouthpark. I will fully test other sites and adjust as I go (some sites might only be reviewed on request).
The current script works for the vidmoly player (might implement it for the others as I go, might not).
Please feel free to ask for requests and, of course, implementing these yourself and creating a pull request so I can review and maybe add it to the script!
I bear no responsibility for any damages caused by this script, so use at own risk (I am :-)).


PS: For the autoplay function to work, you need to allow the site to autoplay sound and video, otherwise it will not work as intended.

In order to allow restoring fullscreen on new page (firefox, maybe works for chrome as well):

1. go to about:config
2. type 'full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only' in the search bar
3. toggle the value to false

Now it should work, but beware: THIS ALLOWS EVERY SITE TO TOGGLE FULLSCREEN AUTOMATICALLY (SECURITY RISK!!!)

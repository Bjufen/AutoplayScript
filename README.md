This is a script to enable an autoplay feature for the sites iwatch..... It is optimised for the style of iwatchtsouthpark. I will fully test other sites and adjust as I go (some sites might only be reviewed on request).
The current script works for the vidmoly player (might implement it for the others as I go, might not).
Please feel free to ask for request and, of course, implementing these yourself and creating a pull request so I can review and maybe add it to the script!
I bear no responsibility for any damages caused by this script, so use at own risk (I am :-)).
